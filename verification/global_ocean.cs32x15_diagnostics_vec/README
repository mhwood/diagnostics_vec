This verification experiment is almost identical to the
global_ocean.cs32x15 experiment, except that it uses
diagnostics_vec to output variables from the model.

To configure and run this demo, complete the following steps:
    1. prepare the run by entering the input directory and 
       running the prepare_run script 
           (e.g. bash prepare_run)
    2. prepare the diagnostic_vec masks by entering the utils 
       directory and running the create_masks.py script
           (e.g. python3 create_masks.py)
    3. build the model using genmake2
    4. run the model

To evaluate the results of this demo, there are two convenient
scripts provided in the utils directory:
- compute_diag_compare.py:
    script to compare numerical differences between
    model output dumped from the 
    diagnostics pkg with that from the diagnostics_vec
    pkg to demonstrate the two result in the same grids
- plot_diag_compare.py
    script to compare visual differences between
    model output dumped from the 
    diagnostics pkg with that from the diagnostics_vec
    pkg to demonstrate the two result in the same grids
Note: each python script must be run from within the utils directory.
