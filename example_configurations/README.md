This repository will contain example configurations demonstrating how to use the diagnostics_vec package for various experiments. Note that these experiments are for demonstration purposes only, and will not be impemented into the main MITgcm branch; the two experiements which **will** be implemented in MITgcm are provided in the verification directory.

The planned list of experiments to be adapted and provided here for demonstration include:
1. [ECCO Version 4 Release 4](https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-v4-Configurations/tree/master/ECCOv4%20Release%204)
2. [LLC540](https://github.com/MITgcm-contrib/llc_hires/tree/master/llc_540)
3. [tutorial_global_oce_latlon](https://github.com/MITgcm/MITgcm/tree/master/verification/tutorial_global_oce_latlon)
4. [tutorial_global_oce_biogeo](https://github.com/MITgcm/MITgcm/tree/master/verification/tutorial_global_oce_biogeo)
5. [tutorial_plume_on_slope](https://github.com/MITgcm/MITgcm/tree/master/verification/tutorial_plume_on_slope)
